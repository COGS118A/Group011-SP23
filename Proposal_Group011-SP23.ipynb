COGS 118A- Project Proposal
https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/dataset/73/mushroom
Project Description
You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project.
The problem addressed will not be a "toy problem" or "common training students problem" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.
The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training a supervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.
The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your ML system.
You will evaluate the performance of your ML system using more than one appropriate metric
You will be writing a report describing and discussing these accomplishments
Feel free to delete this description section when you hand in your proposal.
Peer Review
You will all have an opportunity to look at the Project Proposals of other groups to fuel your creativity and get more ideas for how you can improve your own projects.
Both the project proposal and project checkpoint will have peer review.

Abstract


By using various supervised machine learning techniques we aim to distinguish which mushrooms in our dataset are poisonous and which are safe to eat. First we will split our data into a training set and test set. We will use linear and logistic regression, decision trees, k nearest neighbors, support vector machines and ensembles to classify the training set. Then using Nested Cross Validation we will determine the best hyper parameters for each model and then compare the performance between the models. We will use confusion matrices to check specificity of each model and ROC-AUC curves to compare the performance of the models and select the one whose ROC-AUC score is closest to 1 as the best model. Then we will apply our model on our test set, and use the ROC-AUC score of our performance on the test set to be our measure of success of how well we could distinguish which mushrooms are poisonous. 

Background


There are several risks of eating poisonous mushrooms. Consuming poisonous mushrooms can cause gastrointestinal issues, liver or kidney failure, hallucinations, and even death. The symptoms can differ depending on the species of mushroom and the amount that is ingested[1]. Poisonous mushrooms are still unsafe to consume even after cooking or heating them, so many experts suggest avoiding eating unknown wild mushrooms altogether[2].

It is difficult to tell if mushrooms are poisonous or not from a glance. Mushrooms do not have a clear indicator of whether or not they are poisonous, unlike plants like poison oak or poison ivy. Additionally, there is no at-home test to safely decide whether a mushroom is poisonous or edible[3]. As a result, many sources simply recommend people to only consume store bought mushrooms to avoid suffering from mushroom poisoning.

There have been several reports of people accidentally consuming poisonous mushrooms, some of which were more life-threatening than others. From 1999 to 2016, the U.S. The National Poison Data System recorded over 7000 cases of mushroom exposure[4]. While most of these cases were reported to result in little to no harm, in 2016, it is estimated that there were over 1300 emergency visits and 100 hospitalizations associated with poisonous mushroom ingestion in the United States alone[5]. Many of these cases occur due to people falsely identifying poisonous mushrooms as edible and can be easily prevented.   

Mushrooms have a variety of attributes that can be used to identify what species they belong to. For instance, different species may have unique odors, cap shapes, colors, or ring types. By studying various mushroom attributes, we hope to possibly lower the chances of people misidentifying poisonous mushrooms by creating a machine learning solution that can classify mushrooms as either edible or poisonous. 


Therefore for survival purposes we decide if mushroom yummy or not 
Problem Statement

Given various mushroom attributes such as shape, color, odor, and habitat, we want to be able to classify different species of gilled mushrooms as either edible or poisonous by applying machine learning techniques such as k-nearest neighbors and decision trees.
Data 
Dataset: https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/dataset/73/mushroom

This dataset describes characteristics of mushrooms. It has 22 variables, 8124 observations. Since the data is categorical we will use a one hot encoding on our data to transform it to numerical data so we can apply machine learning algorithms on the data. The “poisonous” variable is the target and thus will be removed when we are training the data. The rest of the variables are categorical descriptive characteristics of the mushrooms which we will use to predict whether they are poisonous

Proposed Solution

First, we will one hot encode our data. The data is categorical and we don’t want to introduce a bias or order to the data, therefore one-hot encoding is the best solution. First we will split our data into training and testing data with a 70 30 percent split respectively. Because our data is so multi-dimensional with 22 variables, it would be incredibly difficult to plot the data and visualize its pattern, ruling out certain models such as kernels which heavily rely on being able to visualize the data. 
Because our data is binary and the mushroom is either poisonous or not, the models we will be testing are k nearest neighbors, trees, linear and logistic regression, as well as SVM and ensembles. To determine which of these models is best suited for our data we will be using Nested Cross Validation to determine the best hyper parameters for each model and then compare the performance between the models. From this, we will pick the best model. We want to ensure that our model is as accurate as possible, so we will be using the following evaluation metrics to test its performance.

Evaluation Metrics

We will be using several different evaluation metrics to measure the percentage of correctly labeled mushrooms. Firstly we will use a confusion matrix and focus on the specificity, because incorrectly labeling a mushroom as edible can be incredibly dangerous. The specificity is calculated as the number of true negatives divided by the total number of negatives selected, we hope to get this number as close to zero as possible. We will also be using a ROC-AUC curve to visualize the comparison between models and select the one whose area is closest to 1. ROC-AUC is calculated by using the true positive rate as the x-axis and the false positive rate as the y-axis.
Ethics & Privacy

One of the ethical issues we have has to deal with bias and discrimination. If our machine learning program is trained on biased or unrepresentative data, it may lead to discriminatory outcomes. For example, if the training data primarily consists of mushrooms from certain geographic regions, the program may misclassify mushrooms from underrepresented regions, potentially leading to false determinations of toxicity. To combat this, we must do extra research into our dataset ensuring diverse and representative training datasets to mitigate bias.

Another issue we must address deals with transparency and explainability. Because machine learning models can be so complex, ethical concerns arise regarding the transparency and explainability of the model's decision-making process. We must inform users about the limitations and uncertainties associated with the model's outputs to ensure responsible usage. Additionally, reliability and safety is a huge concern. The reliability and safety of our machine learning program are crucial ethical considerations. If the program produces inaccurate or unreliable results, it can have serious consequences, such as misclassifying toxic mushrooms as safe or vice versa. Robust testing, validation, and continuous monitoring are necessary to ensure the program's reliability and minimize potential harm. 

We must also address the ethical responsibility that extends to the appropriate use and dissemination of the machine learning program’s findings. Ensuring that our program is used for its intended purpose, such as assisting experts in making informed decisions rather than replacing human expertise entirely, is important. Additionally, clear communication of the program’s limitations and potential risks should be provided to users; informing users that we are not experts and using our algorithm may not give 100% accurate results. Furthermore, the last ethical considerations we want to address deals with the broader social and environmental impacts of our machine learning program. For instance, if the program’s predictions influence foraging practices or commercial mushroom harvesting, it could have implications for local ecosystems, sustainability, and the livelihoods of communities dependent on mushroom-related activities. Responsible usage and consideration of these broader impacts are crucial.

Project Timeline Proposal
Replace this with something meaningful that is appropriate for your needs. It doesn't have to be something that fits this format. It doesn't have to be set in stone... "no battle plan survives contact with the enemy". But you need a battle plan nonetheless, and you need to keep it updated so you understand what you are trying to accomplish, who's responsible for what, and what the expected due dates are for each item.
